1. **Set up Express servers**: Create Express applications for the main server (M) and any additional servers (s1, s2) you need.

2. **Implement WebSocket communication**: Use a WebSocket library like Socket.IO to set up WebSocket connections between clients and the main server (M). Handle WebSocket events to receive and send real-time data.

3. **Define API endpoints**: In the main server (M), define API endpoints using Express to handle HTTP requests from s1 and s2 servers. These endpoints will receive data from s1 and s2 and perform actions like relaying the data to other servers or broadcasting it to clients.

4. **Make HTTP requests from s1 and s2**: In the s1 and s2 servers, use Axios to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints defined in the main server (M). Send the data you want to relay or broadcast to other servers.

5. **Handle HTTP requests in the main server (M)**: Implement route handlers in Express to handle HTTP requests from s1 and s2 servers. Process the data received from these servers and take appropriate actions, such as relaying it to other servers or broadcasting it to clients.

6. **Handle WebSocket events**: In the main server (M), handle WebSocket events to receive data from clients and send data to clients in real-time. Process the data received from clients and take appropriate actions, such as relaying it to other servers or broadcasting it to clients.
